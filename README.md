A golang learning excercise

## Text Editor :: Sublime Text 3
Thanks to [Alex Edwards](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/streamline-your-sublime-text-and-go-workflow) for his helpful post.
I followed a few guidelines, which should work well for any other code editor out there:
- Debug
- Lint / Pretty Format
- Auto Import (import statements are added as packages are being used)
- Auto Complete (less emphasized of all editor features for the purposes of learning)
